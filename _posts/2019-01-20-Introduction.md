Hello everyone!  I want to introduce you to my new Blog concept.  Did anyone out there purchase the 2018-2019 Denver DiningOut PASSBOOK, or the 2019 Eat Denver Card Deck?  Or, maybe you received one as a gift during the 2018 holiday season...  

The Passbook is provided by DiningOut Magazine, and contains Buy One Get One (BOGO) deals for many restaurants in the Denver, CO metro area.  Practically each restaurant included in the Passbook provides both a cocktail BOGO and an entree BOGO, but they cannot both be used in the same visit.  The book was issued in summer, 2018, and the deals in this book are good through July 31, 2019.  Last summer, I found the book offered at $39.99 for two books (it was a BOGO offer).  That deal is now long gone, but Groupon will still get you one for $42 (today, at least) if you are still in the market for the book.  Retail price is labeled as $99.  Included in the book are a variety of over 100 well-known restaurants in the Denver area.

The 2019 Eat Denver Deck is a deck of 55 cards, each providing $10 off a $25 minimum food bill at 55 different restaurants who are members of the EatDenver restaurant association.  These cards can be used through December 31st, 2019.  You can buy the decks at venues around town, or online for about $55.

I intend to visit one of these restaurants each week and write about it, with the hope that my experiences will inspire others to eat out in Denver, and help others choose which restaurants they would like to try.  If I can, II will also provide reviews of other restaurants that are not included the book or the deck.

I hope some of you will join me on a tour of Denver, CO restaurant experiences!  Let's all Eat Denver!
